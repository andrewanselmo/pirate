# DESCRIPTION

This project utilizes a client server relationship to translate an english message into "pirate lingo".
Using a python socket library, you are able to enter an english message on the client side which is 
then chopped up into packets, sent to the server, translated into "pirate", then is sent back to the client. 

# OUTCOMES 
- Learned how a server and client communicate
- Learned about sockets, ports, corruption probabilites, packets, and other networking concepts 

# RUNNING 
- You will need a window for the server and a window for the client. 
- In one window first run the server: cd into client.py, enter '''python3 client.py''' into the terminal
- In the other window run the client: cd into client.py, enter '''python3 client.py''' into the terminal, 
you will then be prompted to enter your english message.
